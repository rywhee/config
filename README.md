# Config

**Config** is a basic checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It gets me up to speed with Git, Ruby, GitHub, Jekyll, and more so I can more quickly get back to coding.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.bash-profile` | Customizes the Terminal.app prompt and echoes the currently checked out Git branch. |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `.gitignore` | The ignore file from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) that I use everywhere. |ïœ€

## Use it yourself

Fork this repo, or just copy-paste things you need, and make it your own. **Please be sure to change your `.gitconfig` name and email address though!**

## Works on my machine

Yup, it does. Hopefully it does on yours as well, but please don't hate me if it doesn't.
